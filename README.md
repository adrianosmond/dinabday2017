# Dina's Birthday, 2017

This was a project I made for Dina's birthday using Preact (boilerplate) and Firebase. To run it on your own you'll need to create your own firebase database and change the config in src/index.ejs to match. Data can be imported from /dina2017-467b9-export.json.

The game mixed challenges in the browser with clues to find around the house, so you might have to look in the code to find the answers to questions etc, but knock yourself out!
